# About
Instead of having tests in the codebase, it might be more interesting to organize these kind of stuff in a database.
It's all experimental, and the way how tests run are not defined by this project though the project itself may provide suggestions.

The goal is to encourage multiple ways of accidental occured testing. So it might not replace basic tests,
but could be set up in such a manner that submitted tests are customer friendly to report while providing
an automated way to tests potential bugs in the code. Please note that this project will only set out a framework
on database level, as implementation requirements can be different for each project.

#Acceptance

Feel free to post anything choppy related. There might be ways to block of irrelevant stuff,
though this should only happen when there is a lack of agreement of getting these kind of stuff in the repo.
